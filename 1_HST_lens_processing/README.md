This folder contains jupyter notebooks needed to download and preprocess the HST images used in the analysis. The HST snapshot images and PSF can be obtained by running all the notebooks in sequence. Information for the HST images can be found at https://stdatu.stsci.edu/hst/abstract.html . Running 4_Psf_Maker.ipynb requires tinytim and more information on tinytim can be found in psf_templates/psf_README
